# HTTP Api Documentation

This guide documents the qaul.net HTTP Api. The Api primarily speaks [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) 
which has its own [Documentation](https://jsonapi.org/format/).

This guide is divided into three sections:

- [Topics] which provides a structured walkthrough of some of the core components of the Api
- [Entities] which documents the various JSON:API entities used throughout the Api
- [Endpoints] which documents the behavior of individual endpoints of the Api
