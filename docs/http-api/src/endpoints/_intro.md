# Endpoints

This section documents the behaviour of the various endpoints that make up the 
core qaul.net HTTP Api. Most of these endpoints speak JSON:API and many of them 
require authentication to use them. Errors that can occur while processing 
JSON:API requests are documented in the [JSON:API](/topics/jsonapi.html) topic, 
and similarly the [Authenticator](/topics/authentication.html) topic documents 
the errors that can occur when authenticating a user.
